"""Golden retrieval fixtures for the eval harness (KG-W6).

These tests own the *fixture* side of the retrieval-quality leg: the golden
record at ``fixtures/retrieval_golden.json`` that LD-W6's ``precision_at_k``
scores. Scoring itself (the metric function, thresholds, the report) is
deliberately NOT here — that is LD-W6's harness. What is asserted here:

* the frozen shape — per-domain keys ``education`` / ``coop-finance``, each
  case carrying ``query`` / ``retrieved_ids`` / ``relevant_ids``;
* id traceability — every id resolves to an identifiable corpus chunk of the
  same domain (``RetrievedChunk`` has no id by frozen SDK contract, so the
  chunk→id mapping lives in the fixture layer; see ``fixtures/README.md``);
* honesty — ``retrieved_ids`` equals a live ``CorpusKnowledgeBase`` ranking
  run over a KB seeded with BOTH domains' corpora, so the golden ordering can
  never be hand-sorted optimism and cross-domain bleed would fail loudly;
* parity — one code path, parametrized over both domains: no domain-specific
  branch exists, and each domain retrieves only from its manifest-declared KB.
